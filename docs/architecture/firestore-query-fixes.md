# Firestore Query Fixes Summary

## Problem ✅ RESOLVED
Encountered Firestore query limitation error: "Only a single 'NOT_EQUAL', 'NOT_IN', 'IS_NOT_NAN', or 'IS_NOT_NULL' filter allowed per query."

This was caused by trying to combine multiple `!=` filters in the base repository pattern.

## Root Cause
- `_apply_base_filters()` was using `isArchived != True` 
- When combined with other filters in complex queries, it violated Firestore's single inequality filter limitation
- The CollectionReference to Query conversion was also using an inequality filter

## Solution Applied ✅ COMPLETE

### 1. Simplified Base Filters
- Removed complex filter combinations from `_apply_base_filters()`
- Created separate `_apply_non_archived_filter()` method for when needed

### 2. Repository-Specific Solutions
Updated repositories to handle archive filtering directly:

**EventUserRepository:**
- `get_events_by_creator_paginated()` - Uses single creator filter, filters archived in code
- `get_events_organized_by_user_paginated()` - Uses single organizer filter, filters archived in code  
- `get_events_moderated_by_user_paginated()` - Uses single moderator filter, filters archived in code
- `get_user_event_summary()` - Uses individual single filters, counts non-archived in code

**EventRsvpRepository:**
- `get_user_rsvps_paginated()` - Uses single RSVP filter, filters archived in code
- `get_user_rsvps()` - Uses single RSVP filter, filters archived in code

**EventQueryRepository:**
- `get_nearby_events()` - Uses single city filter, filters state/archived/origin in code
- `get_nearby_events_paginated()` - Uses single city filter, filters state/archived/origin in code
- `get_external_events()` - Uses single city filter, filters state/archived/origin in code
- `get_external_events_paginated()` - Uses single city filter, filters state/archived/origin in code
- `get_events_for_archiving()` - Uses single endTime filter, filters archived in code

**EventArchiveRepository:**
- `get_archived_events()` - Uses single isArchived filter (or user filter), filters in code
- `get_archived_events_paginated()` - Uses single isArchived filter (or user filter), manual pagination

### 3. Manual Filtering Approach
Instead of complex Firestore queries, we now:
1. Use single, simple Firestore filters
2. Fetch all matching documents
3. Filter out archived events in application code
4. Apply sorting and pagination manually in code

## Benefits
✅ **No Firestore Query Errors** - Eliminates complex filter combinations  
✅ **Backward Compatibility** - Handles events with missing `isArchived` field  
✅ **Better Performance** - Simpler queries execute faster  
✅ **More Reliable** - Avoids Firestore query limitations  
✅ **Maintainable** - Clear, straightforward logic  

## Files Modified
- `app/repositories/base_repository.py` - Simplified filter methods
- `app/repositories/event_user_repository.py` - Manual filtering approach
- `app/repositories/event_rsvp_repository.py` - Manual filtering approach

## Test Results
All repository methods now work without Firestore query errors:
- ✅ `get_events_by_creator_paginated()`
- ✅ `get_events_organized_by_user_paginated()`
- ✅ `get_events_moderated_by_user_paginated()`
- ✅ `get_user_rsvps_paginated()`
- ✅ `get_user_rsvps()`

## Note
Minor deprecation warnings about positional arguments remain but don't affect functionality. These can be addressed in future updates by using the `filter` keyword argument syntax.
