### Session 2: Archive System Implementation (June 28, 2025)

#### **Completed Tasks:**

##### **1. Event Archive Model Design**

- Added archive fields to event model: `isArchived`, `archivedAt`, `archivedBy`, `archiveReason`
- Set default values for new events: `isArchived: false`
- Implemented proper field validation and typing

##### **2. Repository Layer Implementation**

- **File Modified:** `app/repositories/event_repository.py`
- **Methods Added:**
  - `archive_event()` - Soft delete an event with audit trail
  - `unarchive_event()` - Restore archived event
  - `get_archived_events()` - Query archived events with optional user filter
  - `get_archived_events_paginated()` - Paginated archived events with ordering
  - `archive_past_events()` - Bulk archive events that have ended
- **Query Updates:** All existing queries now filter out archived events using `where("isArchived", "!=", True)`

##### **3. Service Layer Implementation**

- **File Modified:** `app/services/event_service.py`
- **Business Logic Added:**
  - Permission validation for archive operations
  - Event status checking (past vs future events)
  - Auto-archive logic with configurable archive reasons
  - Paginated service methods with proper metadata

##### **4. API Endpoints Development**

- **File Modified:** `app/routes/event_routes.py`
- **Endpoints Added:**
  - `PATCH /api/events/{id}/archive` - Archive event (creator only)
  - `PATCH /api/events/{id}/unarchive` - Restore event (creator only)
  - `GET /api/events/me/archived` - User's archived events (paginated)
  - `GET /api/events/archived` - All archived events (admin only, paginated)
  - `POST /api/events/archive/past-events` - Bulk archive past events (admin only)
- **Route Order Fix:** Moved `/archived` routes above `/{event_id}` to prevent FastAPI conflicts

##### **5. Database & Performance**

- **Firestore Indexes:** Created composite indexes for efficient querying
- **Query Optimization:** Implemented proper ordering by `archivedAt` (DESC)
- **Migration:** Retroactive addition of archive fields to existing events

##### **6. Authentication & Security**

- **Role-based Access:**
  - Creators can archive/unarchive their own events
  - Admins can view all archived events and bulk archive
  - Users can only see their own archived events
- **Input Validation:** Archive reason validation and sanitization

##### **7. Testing & Validation**

- **Unit Tests:** Repository and service layer methods
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoints with authentication
- **Edge Cases:** Non-existent events, permission violations, duplicate operations

#### **Technical Decisions:**

1. **Soft Delete Approach:** Chose archive over hard delete for data integrity and audit trail
2. **Pagination Strategy:** Optional pagination to maintain backward compatibility
3. **Permission Model:** Creator-based permissions with admin override capabilities
4. **Query Filtering:** Automatic exclusion of archived events from regular queries
5. **Composite Indexing:** Firestore indexes for efficient paginated queries

- **Added Missing Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/events/{event_id}/rsvp` - RSVP to event with validation
  - `DELETE /api/events/{event_id}/rsvp` - Cancel RSVP with error handling
  - `GET /api/events/{event_id}/rsvps` - Get event RSVP list (paginated)
- **Implementation Details:**

  - Implemented duplicate RSVP prevention
  - Added current attendee count in responses
  - Integrated with existing service layer functions

##### Complete API Documentation Audit

- **Files Reviewed:** All API documentation files in `docs/api/`
- **Verification:** Cross-referenced all documented endpoints with actual implementations
- **Status Confirmed:** All 35+ endpoints now fully implemented and documented

##### API Documentation Enhancement

- **Created:** `docs/api/ENDPOINTS_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive endpoint reference table

### Session 4: Friend System Architecture Refactor (June 28, 2025)

#### **Completed Tasks:**

##### **1. Repository Pattern Analysis and Cleanup**

- Analyzed codebase for violations of repository/service pattern separation
- Identified business logic leakage in repositories and direct database access in services
- Documented violations in routes accessing repositories directly

##### **2. Friend Repository Refactor**

- **File Created:** `app/repositories/friend_repository_clean.py`
- **Improvements:**
  - Removed all business logic and validation from repository layer
  - Eliminated cross-entity method calls (removed user profile building)
  - Created pure data-access-only methods focused on friend request CRUD operations
  - Simplified method signatures and removed unnecessary parameters
  - **Methods:** `create_friend_request()`, `get_request_by_id()`, `find_request_between_users()`, `update_friend_request_status()`, `get_requests_for_user()`, `delete_friend_request()`

##### **3. Service Layer Architecture Split**

- **Original Issue:** Monolithic `FriendService` with 500+ lines mixing concerns
- **Solution:** Split into focused, single-responsibility services:
  - `FriendRequestService` - Friend request lifecycle management
  - `FriendManagementService` - Friend relationship management
  - `UserDiscoveryService` - User search and discovery
  - `FriendService` - Facade pattern for backward compatibility

##### **4. Friend Request Service Optimization**

- **File Optimized:** `app/services/friend_request_service.py`
- **Clean Code Improvements:**
  - Removed unnecessary imports (`UserSearchResult`, `Literal`, `datetime`)
  - Simplified method documentation (removed verbose descriptions)
  - Condensed conditional logic and variable assignments
  - Eliminated redundant variable declarations
  - Streamlined return statements and error handling
  - **Final Result:** 146 lines of clean, focused business logic

##### **5. Route Layer Refactor**

- **File Modified:** `app/routes/friend_routes.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Removed direct repository access from routes
  - Implemented proper service layer dependency injection
  - Updated routes to use instance-based service methods instead of static methods

##### **6. Duplicate Service Cleanup**

- **Issue Identified:** Two `FriendRequestService` files existed after refactoring
- **Solution:** Replaced original file with clean version and removed duplicate
- **Missing Method:** Added `cancel_friend_request()` method to maintain API compatibility
- **Repository Enhancement:** Added `delete_friend_request()` method to clean repository
- **Final Structure:** Single, clean `FriendRequestService` with all required methods

#### **Architecture Benefits:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between data access and business logic
- **Testability:** Each service can be unit tested independently with mocked dependencies
- **Maintainability:** Single-responsibility services are easier to understand and modify
- **Scalability:** New features can be added without affecting existing functionality
- **Code Quality:** Reduced duplication, improved readability, and better error handling

#### **Technical Metrics:**

- **Code Reduction:** `FriendRequestService` reduced from 150+ to 146 lines
- **Dependency Injection:** Proper DI implementation for testing and flexibility
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error response patterns across all methods
- **Type Safety:** Strong typing with proper return type annotations
